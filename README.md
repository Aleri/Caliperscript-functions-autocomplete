Caliperscript-functions-autocomplete
====================================
A while ago I needed to do some programming for TransCad, and created this, to speed up my work.

Auto-complete support for Caliper script (TransCad version 4.5) function syntax  for Sublime Text 2.

To use:
 1. Clone this repo into your ~\Sublime Text 2\Packages\GISDK\ directory (Create GISDK directory if there is none).
 2. Restart Sublime Text 2.
 3. Happy scripting!
